Hi there! I'm Smarts_1l, a developer who likes overcomplicating things and working at a low level.
Aside from assembly, my primary coding languages are C++, C and C#, where I typically work on computer games using SDL or OpenGL, focusing on networking.

Current Projects
- A Low Level Game Engine to make my life easier especially when dealing with networking and OpenGL
- River's Heart - Developer
