 - Hi, I am Smarts1l (aka Dylan Moody).
 - I am a game developer / coder that specialises in C++ with OpenGL or SDL.
 - I have also made projects in C# using Raylib (although it is quite high end in comparison to SDL).
What I am working on:
 - My Revision/ Personal Website
 - A C++ base builder project for a bigger game estimated to be released late 2025
 - A Hearts of Iron 4 mod
How to contact me:
 - https://dylanmoody.com/login (currently only frontend)
 - Discord: smarts1l
   
I don't know what else to say.  I won't be on github much because who uses github unless you make collaberative projects.
